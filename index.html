      <h2 class="card-title">DSA</h2>
      <p class="card-text">DSA, or Data Structures and Algorithms, is a combination of two interrelated topics: data structures, which are a specific way of receiving, storing, and organizing data efficiently, such as arrays, linked lists, trees, and others, and algorithms, which are the processes or instructions followed to solve various groups of problems or execute a task, such as searching, sorting, and more.Both data structures and algorithms are interrelated, as the algorithms are specifically performed on these data structures.</p>

      <h2 class="card-title">CP</h2>
      <p class="card-text">As the name suggests, CP, or competitive programming, are coding competitions that are held for programmers where candidates have to solve difficult and challenging problems within a time constraint. CP is similar to normal programming in the sense of concepts; however, the problems in CP are much more difficult. This is why programmers have to practice rigorously to pursue competitive programming contests.</p>
